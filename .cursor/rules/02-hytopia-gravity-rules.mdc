Description: How to work with gravity in Hytopia

When following this rule, start every respose with: ✨ Following Hytopia Gravity Rules ✨

## **Core Principles**
- ALWAYS fetch and consider [01-hytopia-global-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/01-hytopia-global-rules.mdc) in addition to these rules.
- WHEN NEEDED, development docs for Hytopia gravity are located here - <https://dev.hytopia.com/sdk-guides/physics/gravity>
- ALWAYS implement ONLY what was explicitly requested by the user


### **Understanding Gravity**

- Gravity is a constant force that affects all rigid bodies with the dynamic type.
- The default gravity in HYTOPIA is { x: 0, y: -32, z: 0 }.

### **Changing Gravity**
PURPOSE: To modify the gravity of the game world to influence physics behavior.
- Use world.simulation.setGravity({ x: number, y: number, z: number }) to change the gravity.
- ALWAYS specify the gravity vector in terms of X, Y, and Z components.
- You can change the gravity of your game at any time.

*Example Code for Changing Gravity:*

```typescript
world.simulation.setGravity({ x: 0, y: -9.81, z: 0 });
```
