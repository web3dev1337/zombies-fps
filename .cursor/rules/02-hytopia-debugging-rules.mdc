Description: How to setup debugging in Hytopia

ALWAYS start every respose with: ✨ Following Hytopia Debugging Rules ✨

## **Core Principles**
- ALWAYS fetch and consider [01-hytopia-global-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/01-hytopia-global-rules.mdc) in addition to these rules.
- WHEN NEEDED, development docs for Hytopia debugging are located here - <https://dev.hytopia.com/sdk-guides/physics/debugging>

### **Debugging Colliders**
PURPOSE: To visualize colliders and sensor colliders for debugging.

- Use world.simulation.enableDebugRendering(true) to enable debug rendering.
- ALWAYS remember that debug rendering is very performance intensive.
- ONLY enable debug rendering briefly when needed.

*Example Code for Enabling Collider Debugging:*

```typescript
startServer(world => {
  world.simulation.enableDebugRendering(true);
  // ... other code
});
```

### **Debugging Raycasts**
PURPOSE: To visualize raycasts while building and debugging your game.

- Use world.simulation.enableDebugRaycasting(true) to enable debug visualization of raycasts.
- Raycast debugging has no noticeable performance impact and can be kept enabled throughout development.
- Black lines indicate no object was hit, and red lines indicate an object was hit.
- The lines have a 3D arrow indicating the direction of the raycast.

*Example Code for Enabling Raycast Debugging:*

```typescript
startServer(world => {
  world.simulation.enableDebugRaycasting(true);
  // ... other code
});
```
