Description: Rules to follow when working with entities and the entity manager

When following this rule, start every respose with: ✨ Following Hytopia Entity Rules ✨

## **Core Principles**
- ALWAYS fetch and consider [01-hytopia-global-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/01-hytopia-global-rules.mdc) in addition to these rules.
- ALWAYS use the API reference for available Entity properties and methods - <https://github.com/hytopiagg/sdk/blob/main/docs/server.entity.md>
- When needed, development docs for Hytopia Entities are located here - <https://dev.hytopia.com/sdk-guides/entities>
- ALWAYS implement ONLY what was explicitly requested by the user

### **Understanding Entities**
- Entities are the core objects in any game that can move, interact with physics, and more.
- Examples include player-controlled characters, NPCs, vehicles, movable blocks, and platforms.
- Entities can be either Model Entities (using GLTF format) or Block Entities (defined by size and block texture).


### **Accessing the Entity Manager**
PURPOSE: To manage and retrieve entities in the game world.

- ALWAYS import the `EntityManager` class from Hytopia
- ALWAYS access the `EntityManager` singleton for a world using `world.entityManager`.

### **Using the Entity Manager**
PURPOSE: To retrieve and manage entities in the game world.

- Use `world.entityManager.getAllEntities()` to get an array of all spawned entities.
- Use `world.entityManager.getAllPlayerEntities()` to get an array of all spawned player entities.
- Use `world.entityManager.getPlayerEntitiesByPlayer(player)` to get entities assigned to a specific player.
- Use `world.entityManager.getEntitiesByTag(tag)` to get entities with a specific tag.
- Use `world.entityManager.getEntitiesByTagSubstring(substring)` to get entities with tags containing a substring.

*Example Code for Using Entity Manager:*

```typescript
// Get all entities
const allEntities = world.entityManager.getAllEntities();

// Get player entities for a specific player
const playerEntities = world.entityManager.getPlayerEntitiesByPlayer(player);

// Get entities by tag
const zombieEntities = world.entityManager.getEntitiesByTag('zombie');

// Get entities by tag substring
const entitiesWithO = world.entityManager.getEntitiesByTagSubstring('o');
```
