Description: Rules to follow when working with blocks, chunks, and terrain for Hytopia

When following this rule, start every respose with: ✨ Following Hytopia Blocks & Chunks Rules ✨

## **Core Principles**
- ALWAYS fetch and consider [01-hytopia-global-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/01-hytopia-global-rules.mdc) in addition to the below rules.
- ALWAYS Use the `BlockType`, `BlockTypeRegistry`, `Chunk`, and `ChunkLattice` classes as intended by the SDK developers
- ALWAYS Write clean, effecient code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- ALWAYS implement ONLY what was explicitly requested by the user

## **BlockTypes Implementation**
* USE: To create new block types

- NOTE: Blocks must be registered with `world.blockTypeRegistry` before they set be placed in the world
- ALWAYS create `BlockType` instances using either the `BlockType` class or the `BlockTypeRegistry` class
- ALWAYS Assign each block type a unique ID between 100 and 255 (0 is reserved for air/no block).
- ALWAYS use proper Vector3 formatting
- ALWAYS Use the `textureUri` property to specify the texture for the block.

(Regarding block texture: use a single image URI if all block faces are the same or a directory path containing `+x.png`, `+y.png`, `+z.png`, `-x.png`, `-y.png`, and `-z.png` for individual face textures)

- ONLY set `isLiquid: true` for liquid block types
- ALWAYS utilize `onEntityCollision` or `onEntityContactForce` for interaction with entities. 
- ALWAYS be mindful of the upcoming coordinate data for `onEntityCollision`.
- REMEMBER, ALWAYS register `BlockType` instances with the `world.blockTypeRegistry` before use.

*Example Code - creating a block type using block type registry:*

```typescript
    const bouncyBlockId = 77;
    world.blockTypeRegistry.registerGenericBlockType({
        id: bouncyBlockId, // must be between 1 and 255, cannot be 0, 0 is reserved for air or "no block".
        textureUri: 'blocks/clay.png',
        name: 'Bouncy Clay',
        customColliderOptions: {
            bounciness: 5,
        }
    });
```

*Example Code - creating a block using BlockType wth a Collision Callback:*

```typescript
    const sandKnockbackBlockId = 55;
    const sandKnockbackBlockType = new BlockType({
        id: sandKnockbackBlockId,
        textureUri: 'blocks/sand.png',
        name: 'Knockback Sand',
    });

    sandKnockbackBlockType.onEntityCollision = (blockType, entity, started) => {
        if (started) {
            entity.applyImpulse({ x: 0, y: 20, z: 0}); // apply vertical knockback shooting them up.
        }
    };

    world.blockTypeRegistry.registerBlockType(sandKnockbackBlockType);
```

## **Block Type Registry**
* USE: To manage and register all available block types in the world.

- Use the `world.blockTypeRegistry` to register new block types using `registerBlockType()` or `registerGenericBlockType()`.
- Retrieve block types by ID using `getBlockType(id)`.
- Enumerate all registered block types using `getAllBlockTypes()`.

## **Chunks**
* USE: To organize blocks into manageable units (16x16x16 blocks).

- Chunks are automatically created and managed by the `ChunkLattice`.

## **Chunk Lattice**
* USE: To manage the overall terrain and provide efficient access to blocks within the world.

- ALWAYS use `chunkLattice.hasBlock(coordinate)` to check if a block exists at a given coordinate.
- ALWAYS Use `chunkLattice.setBlock(coordinate, blockTypeId)` to set or remove a block at a specific coordinate.  
- ALWAYS Use `blockTypeId = 0` to remove a block. (This replaces the block with "air")
- ALWAYS Use `chunkLattice.getBlockType(coordinate)` to get the block type ID at a specific coordinate.
