# Complete Investigation: Missing Damage Numbers

## Timeline of Events
- Start of day: Damage numbers working
- Various commits throughout the day (performance fixes, pathfinding, etc.)
- End of day: NO damage numbers appear at all

## Critical Finding

After thorough investigation, I've identified several potential causes:

### 1. UI Path Issue (MOST LIKELY)
- `GamePlayerEntity.ts` loads UI from: `'ui/index.html'`
- Actual UI file location: `assets/ui/index.html`
- The Hytopia SDK likely prepends 'assets/' automatically, but this may have changed

### 2. SceneUI World Context
The damage numbers use SceneUI which requires:
- A valid world context
- Proper template registration
- The UI to be loaded for the player

### 3. Hit Point Null Check
```typescript
if (fromPlayer && hitPoint) {
  // UI notification code
}
```
If `hitPoint` is null/undefined, NO UI is shown at all.

### 4. Possible SDK Changes
The recent SDK updates may have changed:
- How SceneUI works
- How raycasts return hit points
- How UI paths are resolved

## Debug Strategy

I've added logging to trace:
1. **GunEntity**: Logs if raycast has hitPoint
2. **EnemyEntity**: Logs if UI notification conditions are met
3. **SceneUIManager**: Logs if showHitNotification is called
4. **SceneUI Creation**: Logs if SceneUI is created and loaded

## Most Probable Cause

The damage numbers completely disappearing (not just mispositioned) suggests:
1. The UI template isn't being loaded/found
2. The hit point is null/undefined
3. The SceneUI system is failing silently

## Recommended Fix

1. First, verify the UI is loading:
   ```typescript
   this.player.ui.load('assets/ui/index.html'); // Try full path
   ```

2. Add fallback for missing hitPoint:
   ```typescript
   if (fromPlayer) { // Remove hitPoint requirement
     const displayPosition = hitPoint || this.position;
     // ... rest of UI code
   }
   ```

3. Check console logs from debug code to identify exact failure point
